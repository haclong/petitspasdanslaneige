      <p><p>As far as I get it and though I don’t really know if i can convince you, i realize that models/entities/classes shouldn’t be dependant of each other. The less they are dependant, the better.</p>
<p>This, translated to common words, can be sum up VERY ROUGHLY :</p>
<p><cite>Do not use <code>new</code> keyword within any of your classes.</cite></p>
<p>Another way to check if your class is tightly dependent : check the <code>use</code> keyword : if your object is using TOO much different objects and moreover from different modules/libraries/concepts, than we can say there’s something wrong with the way you build it up.</p>
<p>Then, HOW to use other classes without creating new objects ?</p>
<p>We instanciate objects and then, INJECT them into our classes.</p>
<h3>How to inject dependencies ?</h3>
<p>There’s different strategies :</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>constructor</strong>, create a constructor with as many arguments as you have dependencies and set each argument to a property. From outside that object, you create all the objects you need and pass them through the constructor. With this strategy, you ensure that the dependencies are mandatory.</p>
<p>You can use <strong>setter methods</strong>, just like for any of your property. With this strategy, you cannot be sure the dependencies are mandatory. You have to manage de default status if any.</p>
<p>You can use <strong>interfaces</strong>, though i don’t get this right so i won’t talk about that part.</p>
<p>Within our class, the dependency will be a property just like another and, still within the class, we will manipulate and return such property and barely not caring whether the dependency is an instance of class A or class B… All our class has to know is just HOW to use its dependency.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule :</p>
<p><strong>Factory</strong> object HAS to use the <code>new</code> keyword. It is because they are factories. They are meant to return a new object.</p>
<p>And for my part, I don’t inject <code>ArrayObject</code> either. I consider it as a type more than a dependency… But it is a personal point of view and i am still thinking whether it is right or wrong.</p>
<h3>Instanciating objects</h3>
<p>Oh… of course… I said earlier : <em>We instanciate objects and then, INJECT them into our classes.</em> I have covered roughly the injection part but now, WHERE to instanciate objects, since no classes can use the <code>new</code> keyword…</p>
<p>We will use a higher level object. In that object, we will instanciate all our objects : the dependencies and all the other objects, with the injections whether by constructor or by setters.</p>
<p>Zend Framework 2 has that kind of useful component : the <strong>Service Manager</strong>. I’m quite sure that other frameworks do have a similar component but i haven’t tested them yet so i don’t know how the Service Manager is called with Symfomy, Laravel etc… Just find out how to use it.</p>
<p>The <strong>Service Manager</strong> is a kind of index where we can declare each of your classes. This is, roughly, the only component of the module where we will use all our <code>new</code> instructions and instanciate each of our objects at least once. The only one.</p>
<h3>Using the objects</h3>
<p>All our <strong>model</strong> objects (entities, mappers, factories, forms) are instanciated (therefore created) within the <strong>Service Manager</strong> as well as their dependencies. So, technically, you won’t need to access the <strong>Service Manager</strong> from within the model objects. Because you won’t have to call for any external classes from within your class since all the dependencies are already injected from the <strong>Service Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>For the particular case of an array of object, the old fashioned way to do this is to have a <code>foreach</code> loop and instanciate a <code>new</code> object for each iteration. Since the object is injected only once in our object, use the <code>clone</code> functionality instead. Do the <code>foreach</code> loop and <code>clone</code> the injected dependency rather than instanciating from nowhere.</p>
<p>It leaves the <strong>Views</strong> : objects used by the view should be pushed by the <strong>Controller</strong>. It leaves the <strong>plugins</strong>… I’ll cover that part once i’ll have to work with views plugins more…</p>
<p>Then the <strong>Controller</strong> : Controller classes in Zend Framework implements the <strong>ServiceLocatorAware</strong> interface which allow them to access to the <strong>Service Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>When i started to use ZF2, i was looking everywhere for tips on how to access the <strong>Service Manager</strong>. But you likely do not need that answer. You shouldn’t need that answer.</p>
<p>I find benefits while instanciating all my objects in the <strong>Service Manager</strong> : if i ever do a refactoring of my code, rearranging the namespace, splitting one module in two differents modules, it is easy peasy… just change the links in your <strong>Service Manager</strong> and the rest of the code remain unmoved. This save my time several time.</p>

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I learned coding with php several years ago, when Internet was still young. For multiple reasons, i had stopped then and missed most of this new Internet i&#39;m discovering once again. So, i feel like a newbie again and since i&#39;m ready to start over personal project, i&#39;ll share with you some of my discoveries. Beyond coding topics, i&#39;ll enjoy sharing with you several subjects such as History, Astronomy, Linguistics, Movies, Books, Music and Anime among others. I hope you&#39;ll enjoy reading this blog.</p>
