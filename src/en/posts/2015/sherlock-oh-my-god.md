summary: "By now, everybody know that we won't have any brand new Sherlock Cumberbatch season before at least 2016. Which is plain torture. BUT, hail to the Sherlock team, they love us just enough to prevent any heart failure for the wait."

By now, everybody know that we won't have any brand new Sherlock Cumberbatch season before at least 2016. Which is plain torture. BUT, hail to the Sherlock team, they love us just enough to prevent any heart failure for the wait.

Anyway, they don't have time to shot an entire new season of the BBC Show but they do have time to tease us and make us fan drool.

Here comes the teaser for the upcoming Sherlock Special that we will see for Christmas 2015. And if you've been good enough, maybe Père Noël will bring the Special straight into your closest movie theater !!! HEY !!

And, last but not least because we can't get enough of gorgeous Benedict Cumberbatch (*now, do I sound girlie, don't I ?*), here are the apologies of Andrew Moriarty Scott, Mark Mycroft Gatiss and Benedict Hamlet Cumberbatch for not attending the San Diego Comic Con.

Oh i can't wait !
