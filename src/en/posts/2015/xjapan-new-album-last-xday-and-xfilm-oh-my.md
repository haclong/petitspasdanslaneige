Ok... this is cold news now... I SHOULD have posted this last week but... well... anyway... OH MY GOD !

Just OH MY GOD

YOSHIKI was in Japan Expo last week, Saturday July 4th 2015. He announces three upcoming events for the X Japan timeline :

- A documentary about XJapan that we will probably remember as the XFilm. No doubt this will be the perfect opportunity to insert footages of dear hide.
- A concert at Wembley Arena, London for March 12 2016. Tickets are already on sale so don't wait too long to get yours... This is the XDay.
- An album AT LAST AN ALBUM OH GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE IT *and I will believe it truly only once i'll get the precious item between my hand...*
