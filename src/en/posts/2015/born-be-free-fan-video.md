summary: "Fans are exclusives... But the new single is just awesome !!"

Oh my god, this single have been around since 2010. Maybe before that date. I have seen it on internet. I loved it. The single is out since Novembre 6 and X Japan has released a video as a tribute for their fans.

Fans are just exclusive. They are just too much. But it feels so good :)
