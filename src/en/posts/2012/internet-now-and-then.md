summary: "It's been a long time since last time I've done serious web programming here. Now, i'm back to work and i discover by the way that there are a lot of things and worries which did not exists then. Therefore, even if programming for internet feel easy and even easier with new tools, it is in fact more demanding and hard to go out there."

It's been a long time since last time I've done serious web programming here. Now, i'm back to work and i discover by the way that there are a lot of things and worries which did not exists then. Therefore, even if programming for internet feel easy and even easier with new tools, it is in fact more demanding and harder to go out there.

**More terminals**
Creating websites does now involve at least three different templating formats : landscape formatting for desktop screens, minimalized portrait formatting for mobile screen, bigger size for connected TV screens and do not forget tablet screens of course. More terminals involve more navigators. There are not only Internet Explorer and Firefox today, there are also Chrome, Safari and all others navigators belonging to mobile phones vendors.
By the way, there is a real ease to know that amongst all the smartphones out there, the possibility for their OS - therefore their navigators - will be reduced to a very few choices. Rationalization also hit the mobile phones business. We are new far from the ancient model : one mobile = one dedicated OS. We should to glorify the rationalization's rules more than we ought to do.

**More risks**
More people using the Internet mean more risks for security breachs. SQL injection menace gets now a scarier name aka Cross Scripting (XSS). Websites users can now be either robot, human, web services, rss feed. We are not alone anymore. Robots roam the web and can spam any type of forms which are not slightly protected by a captcha mechanism. More people out there mean there's more question about privacy. Leave you email address anywhere and you're sure to get spams into your mailbox one day or another one.

**More tools**
Beyond all those menaces, Internet has developped toolboxes, frameworks and library to ease the building process. Now there are tons and tons of frameworks out there ready for you to use. Templating your site ? You can use CSS frameworks such as <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint</a> or <a href="http://thesquaregrid.com/">The Square Grid</a> which will help you build grid based website templates. Hard time with javascript, DHTML and layer ? Forget all of your pain. Here come <a href="http://mootools.net/">Mootools javascript framework</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery javascript library</a>. Afraid of cross scripting ? You can use filters such as <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/">HTML Purifier</a> to do the job.

If you wish, you can code your own website without bothering starting over all the code from scratch. Pick any php frameworks outhere such as <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>, <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a> or <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">Symphony</a>. You can even map your database model using ORM layer such as <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine</a>. You can even build entire set of unit testing with <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit">phpUnit</a>

Not feeling about coding your website ? You'd rather get a ready-to-go package to create a website as fast as possible ? This is even easier. You can use ready-to-use dedicated packages to create galleries, forums, online store, your CRM... You can pick CMS and start with it as a construction starter kit and use add-ons, plugins, modules... those gets a lot of name but add functionnalities to your website. Browse the internet for CMS such as <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a> or <a href="http://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>.

**More pro**
Internet gets bigger and it seems there's no more room for *amateur*. You can't just improvize yourself as web programmers as easily as we used then. Of course, there's still braves who believe in their luck but things gets harder anyway. Websites are gadgets no more. There are serious business and they ought to be fast, performat, lethal, intelligent. They use full teams to build them, apply various design patterns or system development methodologies such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern or Agile method. Small amateur-like websites are wiped out by social networks.

Internet gets more and more fun to use. You have to manage more and more concepts such as design patterns, database mappings. Web programmation can get very philosophical. You have time to think more deeply, to build concepts, to reflect on the what and no more on the how.
