It can be used by links or by sitemap building. AND it may be helpful to render a menu.\n\nYou don't need to use Zend Navigation, even in an application built with Zend Framework. You can build your own key-value pair array and build your own menu.\n\nThis post was dedicated to the Zend Navigation component of Zend Framework v1.\n\nI hope you enjoy my other posts though"
