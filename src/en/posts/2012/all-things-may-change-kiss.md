France family leagues are standing up against the government law project about wedding for all. When all politicians are debating about the GLTB rights to marry, in the streets, french leagues are manifesting calmly. This is the perfect time for exchanging a kiss to seal all of it.

In the middle of a family league manifestation, two girls just stand up and kiss. I love to watch at all those chocked faces on the background. And both girls looks quite nice :D
