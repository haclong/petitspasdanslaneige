After the Trianon performance in Paris, i finally get to the Royal Festival in London. It seems 2014 is a year where meant to attend a lot of duplicated events :p

### The venue

The Royal Festival Hall is located on the Thames Southbank, near the Waterloo tube station, right under the London Eye. Compared to the parisian venue, Le Trianon theater, the londonian venue is much more modern (inaugurated in 1951 and refurbished on 2007) than the old parisian caf√© theatre (1895). The Royal Festival Hall is also much more bigger, welcoming around 2500 seats whence the Trianon has only 1091 seats availables.

The Royal Festival is therefore a very clean place, with straight lines, modern furnitures and materials, high ceiling and somehow very big yet cold too while the Trianon is smaller, darker with its heavy curtains, the 19th century style ceiling, the old fashioned balconies, so romantic with their old gold paint and the deep red velvet. But the Royal Festival do have a Royal Balcony with the armcoat of the british monarchy... So cool.

### The setlist

The Setlist in London is pretty the same he played in Paris. For the customized performance, Yoshiki chooses to play Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. The scene in the Royal Festival Hall seems much bigger than the one in Paris but everything looks fine nonetheless.

### The public

The Royal Festival Hall has numbered seats. Which means you know where's you seating when you buy your place. So, it is much less stress. You don't have to line up several hours before attending the concert and you don't spent all your day defending your place in the queue. You can buy your ticket, take some drinks at the numerous cafe and bars around and go to the hall at the last minute.

In Paris, you know for sure who's coming because they are waiting in the line. In London, you don't know who's coming since they are scattered all around the place, on resting chair or in bars and pubs and cafes. You can't know for sure. Sometimes, a Yoshikitty will emerge from the opening of a bag or they are wearing X Japan Tshirts but they are very few adorning X Japan signs. But i've noticed a concentration of japanese persons. Much more than anywhere else in London.

At the door of the concert hall, there was a big poster of Yoshiki World Tour and the poster were signed by all His fans throughout the world.

The closer you get to the doors, the more you know about who's coming. And indeed, all the japanese people I have seen in the neighbourhood seem all to converge to the Hall now. But they are also a lot of people dressed very finely, obviously not belonging to the X Japan Fandom. It turns out that the Royal Festival Hall is a venue dedicated mostly for classical performance. And all those people are expecting to go to a classical concert...

You have to know one thing, if you've never been to a classical concert : Classical concert audience does not talk, they barely laugh, they do not cheers and they certainly not screaming We Are X between each pieces... I don't know for other venues Yoshiki went, but the ambiance in the Royal Festival Hall was really different from the one in Paris. Where we have cheers and applauded and express our pleasure loudly in Paris, once in London, every thing was always calm and good measured... In the second act, some fans dare to cheers and applauded louder but nothing compared to the Paris concert.

On the other hand, classical musicians do not have mic to talk to the public, they do not complain publicly about a fan or about the snapping sound of a camera, and they don't attempt to make jokes like in a one man show... They just sit with their instruments and play their part without a word, barely with even a look to the public, they bow when they've finished and nobody ever hear the sound of their voice or even know what they are thinking.

We were at a classical concert performed by a rockstar. That having been said, there's nothing more to say.
