summary: "Now let's talk about GoCD setup on my localhost.\n

At the beginning, i planned to write a single article but the more i wrote about the topic, the more i had to talk about. I really tried to write something short but it turned out that i'd need more than one article to talk about GoCD.\n

We will start first with the installation, though my own install is quite old and i don't remember very well how i did it but i'd try nonetheless. Beside, it can be helpful nonetheless. I truly hate incomplete tutorial where it is assumed that the reader knows more than he does..."

Now let's talk about GoCD setup on my localhost.

At the beginning, i planned to write a single article but the more i wrote about the topic, the more i had to talk about. I really tried to write something short but it turned out that i'd need more than one article to talk about GoCD.

We will start first with the installation, though my own install is quite old and i don't remember very well how i did it but i'd try nonetheless. Beside, it can be helpful nonetheless. I truly hate incomplete tutorial where it is assumed that the reader knows more than he does...

Then i will talk really shortly about concepts within GoCD though you will find the <a href="https://docs.go.cd/current/introduction/concepts_in_go.html" target="_blank">complete documentation</a> on their website

And finally, what is the most important thing here : what have i done :)
