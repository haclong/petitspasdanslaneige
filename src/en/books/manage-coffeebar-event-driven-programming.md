summary: "Spontaneously, i will use procedural programming. One step after another. Like a todo list with every tasks done in order.\n

I believe procedural programming is a much understandable paradigm because it is based on a succession of ordered tasks and the order is (well should) be easy to follow.\n

But of course, other options are available. Let's explore the event driven programming paradigm with an MVC application based on Zend Framework 2. We will implement a small application to handle the orders of a coffee bar."

Spontaneously, i will use procedural programming. One step after another. Like a todo list with every tasks done in order.

I believe procedural programming is a much understandable paradigm because it is based on a succession of ordered tasks and the order is (well should) be easy to follow.

But of course, other options are available. Let's explore the event driven programming paradigm with an MVC application based on Zend Framework 2. We will implement a small application to handle the orders of a coffee bar.

Added to the discovery of the event driven programming, we will also need to manage the dependencies in forms with two use cases :

- a first form with a simple list of values injected in a Select element
- a second form with a list of Objects (and their properties) in a Select element, tied to an input text field and a counting.

The whole application can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/haclong/coffeebar" target="_blank">github</a>
